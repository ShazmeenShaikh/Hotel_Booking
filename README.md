# Hotel_Booking

In a world where almost everything is digitized and anything can be done with a few clicks, including booking and cancellation of hotels, businesses are forced to adapt and accommodate consumers’ rapidly changing plans. 
The service industry especially has the unique challenge of ensuring they have the appropriate amount of resources available at the right time to meet their customers’ needs. 
To stay in competition, the hotels are providing free cancellation fees. This tactic encourages people who are uncertain of their plans to go ahead and book the room because there is no negative consequence if they aren’t particularly serious about their trip and must cancel.
While there might not be any risk for the consumer, there is a substantial amount of concern around cancellations from the hotel’s perspective.
#The main problem we are trying to solve
The rate of cancellations is rising because third party vendors often persuade individuals to use their services by advertising the lack of cancellation fees. Matter of fact, in 2018 the hotel cancellation rate seemed to reach its peak at around 40% [Hospitality Tech News, 2020]. To alleviate the cancellation, the hotels overbook the rooms in order to compensate for any cancelled room. 
The issue with overbooking is that the hotels don't know how many customerswillcancel. Overbookingmightbetotheextentthatthehotelwouldhavetoturn customers away. This can result in damaging their brand image and the hotel will end up losing those customers forever. In other cases, There could be fifty empty rooms each night if there is no overbooking. 
This problem could be solved by using predictive analytics which will identify cancellations and overbooking.
That will allow us to overbook at an appropriate rate to ensure we have enough rooms available for the customers, while keeping empty rooms to a minimum.
The Hotel industry can make a lot of use from this analysis. Once the Executives and manager understand the problem, they can appoint a data analyst to find solutions and personalize it according to the needs of the hotel. Along with this, students and professionals who want to ​understand exploratory data analysis (EDA) or get started in building predictive models can use this case.
